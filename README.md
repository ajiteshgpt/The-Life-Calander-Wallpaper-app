# ⏳ Life Calendar: Existential Crisis in 4K

> **"Visualize Time. Live Intentionally."**

Welcome to **Life Calendar**, the only app that replaces your cheerful vacation photos with the cold, hard reality of your fleeting existence—now optimized for your curved screen.

Why look at a picture of your cat when you can stare at a pixel-perfect grid of how many weeks you have left before you become a memory? *Memento Mori*, but make it Material 3.

## 🍎 The Inspiration (And The "Why")

**Heavily inspired by the genius concept of "The Life Calendar".**

Let's be real: On iOS, setting this up is easy. You just run a **Shortcut**, set a trigger, and boom—instant anxiety.

**But on Android?** It’s a total headache. You usually have to download a wallpaper engine, find a specific preset, tweak the settings, sacrifice a goat to the KWGT gods, and write three lines of JSON just to see a dot.

**I did the work so you don't have to.**
As a student, I didn't want to waste time configuring widgets or messing with automation scripts every morning. I built a single, native Android app to do it all for me. No shortcuts, no "pro version" needed to change the color. Just install, open, and let the existential dread wash over you.

## 🚀 The Three Modes of Reality

### 1. 🧬 The Life Calendar (Existential Mode)
Visualizes your entire lifespan in a 52-column grid (one for every week of the year).

* **The Vibe:** Watching your HP bar deplete in a high-stakes RPG where there are no respawns.
* **Data Points:** Shows total weeks passed and your age in `Years : Months : Days`.
* **Tech Flex:** Automatically calculates expectancy based on an 80-year projection (adjustable if you plan on living forever).

### 2. 📅 The Year Calendar (Speedrun Mode)
A 365-dot grid tracking the current year.

* **The Vibe:** Realizing that January was 3 years ago and tomorrow is already December.
* **Customization:** Toggle between "Year Completed" (for the optimist) or "Year Left" (for the realist).
